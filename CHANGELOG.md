# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (Unreleased)

All static site generation is now removed and mdzk works purely as a CLI (or
library) for querying your note vault for forward/backward links.

### Major breaking changes

- Wikilinks are no longer parsed---use regular markdown links instead.
- Static site generation is no longer built-in. You can use an external tool
  like Hugo or Zola to generate a static site from your mdzk vault.
- The default JSON output is now a list of notes, instead of an object
  containing only one key, `notes`.
- The `content` field on each note is removed.
- The `date` field on each note is removed.

### New features

- Obviously a massive increase in performance

## 0.5.2 (2022-02-22)

### Fixes

- [#70](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/issues/70): Fixed issue where
  parentheses were not allowed in internal links.

    577e84c: allow non-square brackets in internal links

## 0.5.1 (2022-02-21)

### Added

- [#66](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/pull/66): All CSS variables can now be
  changed directly in the configuration file. For example, say you want to set
  the variable `--sidebar-bg` to `red`. To do this, you can simply add

    ```toml
    [style]
    sidebar-bg = "red"
    ```

    This should work for all CSS variables.

- [#66](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/pull/66): Add any custom CSS through the
  configuration file. You can either write CSS as a string directly in
  `mdzk.toml`, like this:

    ```toml
    [style]
    additional-css = """
    <CSS here>
    """
    ```

    or you can load a separate CSS file, like this:

    ```toml
    [style]
    additional-css = "path/to/file.css"
    ```

    Paths are relative to the `mdzk.toml` file.

### Changed

- [#66](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/pull/66): mdzk now has a custom renderer
  and a new look. Everything should look more clean and polished, and you can
  expect some performance improvements as well.
- [#66](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/pull/66): KaTeX is no longer loaded
  through a CDN, but written to the generated site. This means your mdzk will
  work offline as well.
- [#66](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/pull/66): The default renderer is no
  longer `mdbook`, but `mdzk`. You can change back to rendering with mdBook by
  adding `--renderer mdbook` after the build command.

### Fixed

- [#67](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/issues/67): You could previously not use
  `?` characters in a title, because they were not escaped properly in URLs.
  This is now fixed with the introduction of our custom renderer.
- [#66](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/pull/66): Note titles are now added to
  the search index as well.

### Removed

- [#66](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/pull/66): You can no longer theme mdzk
  like in mdBook (by adding a directory called `theme`). See above for how you
  can customize your mdzk.

## 0.5.0 (2022-01-03)

### New features

- [#55](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/pull/55): You can now turn off each
  preprocessor feature of mdzk separately. This is done with the following
  configuration values:

    ```toml
    [build]
    # ...
    front-matter = false
    math = false
    readme = false
    math = false
    ```

    More about these features and what they do, can be found in the
    [documentation](https://mdzk.app/docs).

- [#39](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/issues/39): Wikilinks now support
  blockreferences. Mark a paragraph with an ID by appending it with a space, a
  `^` and then a six-character ID. Then you can link to this paragraph, by using
  the syntax `[[Note^#id]]`, where `Note` is the name of the note and `id` is
  the ID of the paragraph. You can read more about blockreferences in
  [the documentation](https://mdzk.app/docs).

### Enhancements

- [#54](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/issues/54): Our separate preprocessor
  crates are now moved to within the mdzk crate. This allows us to avoid
  iterating over the vault multiple times, which drastically increases the
  efficiency.
- [#45](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/issues/45): New custom made user
  interface, for a friendlier look. Expect more informative messages from this
  update and on.
- Enabled pulldown-cmark's SIMD accelerated scanners.

### Bug fixes

- [#63](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/pull/63): Fixed buggy KaTeX rendering
  and simplified the rendering code a lot. Special thanks to
  [@TheFr1nge](https://github.com/theFr1nge) for fixing this.
- [#41](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/pull/41): mdzk will not panic on invalid
  TOML anymore, but rather print an error message coupled with the configuration
  content and a description of what part of it is invalid.
- [#40](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/pull/40): mdzk now checks whether you
  updated your `mdzk.toml` correctly or not. If a `[book]` section is found in
  your `mdzk.toml` file, a warning will appear that prompts the user to change
  it to `[mdzk]`.
- When loading the mdzk from another directory than the root directory, parsing
  the summary would throw an error, as the path to it was not absolute. This is
  now fixed, which means you can build an mdzk located anywhere, from anywhere.

## 0.4.3 (2021-11-01)

### New features

- New `generate-summary` key at the `[mdzk]` section in `mdzk.toml` that
  controls whether mdzk will generate your summary file automatically or not.
  The default value is `true`.
- New `preprocessors` field under the `[build]` section in `mdzk.toml`. This
  lets you define
  [mdBook preprocessors](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/configuration/preprocessors.html)
  to be run after the default preprocessors. Order is preserved.
- New `draft` option in the front matter. Setting this to `true` will skip
  rendering for that note.

    **NOTE**: Beware that the note will still show up in the index, as that is
    how mdBook handles draft chapters. We will probably change this behaviour as
    soon as we release our custom renderer. If you want to hide a note
    completely from your vault, use the `ignore` field in `mdzk.toml`.

### Enhancements

- Removed several dangerous `unwrap`s, to make the codebase more robust.
- The Nix build now supports Apple Silicon as well.
- Dependencies have been cleaned up, leading to a slightly smaller binary size.
- New version of mdbook-wiklinks (0.4.0), that replaces regexes in favor of a
  combination of [pulldown-cmark's](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark) iteration
  and a custom [Pest](https://pest.rs/) parser. This should decrease build times
  drastically.
- Math delimiters are now converted into spans/divs on build. This will
  hopefully make KaTeX support more robust, and ignore math rendering within
  code and links.

### Bug fixes

- [#38](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/issues): User-defined preprocessors
  (through the mdBook-style `preprocessor.<name>` pattern in the config file)
  would sometimes interfere with mdzk's default preprocessors. This fix converts
  all of these preprocessor-statements into the `preprocessors` field mentioned
  above, which mdzk can handle the order of.

    **NOTE**: To simplify compatibility between mdzk and mdbook, we assume the
    preprocessor has a command on the form `mdbook-<name>`. Other preprocessors
    are simply not supported yet. Fields are ignored, so you can only turn
    preprocessors on or off.

- [#24](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/issues/24): `mdzk.backlinks-header` in
  the config had no defuault value, which made mdzk panic when it was not set.
  This is now fixed.

## 0.4.2 (2021-09-24)

This is a quick update that should make compiling mdzk easier (and even
possible) for Windows users.

We have also experienced some trouble with Windows Defender flagging
pre-compiled mdzk binaries as a trojan. **This is a false positive.** A report
is submitted to Microsoft, and we have removed all previously released Windows
binaries. We suspect the warning is related to the amount of embedded JavaScript
that is contained in mdzk. Hopefully, you will not get any warnings from this
version and onwards. If you do, please leave a comment with a screenshot of the
warning in [this issue](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/issues/22).

### New features

- When naming a file the same name as it's parent directory, this file will work
  as the content of that directory. Namely, the directory will itself function
  as a note.

### Bug fixes

- Our dependency on [`mdbook-katex`](https://github.com/lzanini/mdbook-katex),
  and subsequently QuickJS, did not work well with most Windows computers. To
  circumvent this, KaTeX is now loaded from a CDN and handles the rendering
  client-side. This shouldn't lead to any significant increases in load time,
  but it is not ideal for offline usage. We are working on embedding KaTeX
  locally in the generated output, which hopefully will be included soon.

## 0.4.1 (2021-09-23)

### Enhancements

- The mdzk renderer now converts `.md` into `.html` in links/images during
  rendering.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed `init` command. It did not produce a correctly formatted config file,
  and a subsequent build failed.

## 0.4.0 (2021-09-20)

### Breaking changes

- The `[book]` table header in `mdzk.toml` is now changed to `[mdzk]`. You will
  need to change this in your own configuration, or else the values will be
  ignored.
- The `disable-default-processors` configuration option is now placed under the
  `[build]` table.

### New features

- An `ignore` field is added under the `[mdzk]` table. This is a list of
  gitignore-style patterns that specify files or directories which mdzk should
  ignore when building.
- The header above the backlinks can now also be configured under the `[mdzk]`
  table, with the `backlinks-header` field. Both this and the previous
  `preprocessor.backlinks.header` field are supported, but you are recommended
  to use the former, in case we might remove the latter.
- You can now choose a renderer with the `--renderer` or `-r` flag when running
  `build` or `serve`. The choices are between `mdbook`, `markdown` or `mdzk`,
  the latter being our own work in progress custom renderer. This feature is
  mostly for debugging purposes.

### Enhancements

- We now use our own configuration struct. This will allow us to more easily
  expand mdzk with more options and configuration.
- The mdzk renderer now copies over KaTeX locally in the output, to ensure
  speedy math rendering.
- The mdzk renderer now uses the Inter font.

## 0.3.7 (2021-09-05)

0.3.7 moves mdzk to a monorepo structure. No other changes.

## 0.3.6 (2021-09-03)

### Enhancements

- The binary's size is now a lot smaller. (f5e6ca4b4bc98e98a3f28a5859665a332ff10262)
- Sorting now works with non-ASCII characters. (16bb74d62314c4bdaa75809b64caae3e9b2ec7dc)

## 0.3.5 (2021-08-31)

### Enhancements

- Summary is now sorted by directories first. (78f98d040fe4674c34571d115d8e7de10c14eb97)

### Bug fixed

- Added `*.hbs` files to Cargo.toml. (3b4bcd98374b4463143fd81cf621b97c198bafae)

## 0.3.4 (2021-08-27)

### Enhancements

- Moved to `lazy_regex` for lazy evaluation of regexes instead of doing this
  manually with `lazy_static`. This hopefully brings some minor speed
  improvements.

### Bug fixes

- `'` and `"` threw errors when compiling, because these characters were escaped
  in their filename, meaning mdzk could not find the source.
- The URLs produced by our preprocessors did not escape special characters
  properly. This is now fixed, meaning URLs should all work properly again.
  Unsupported characters are documented in the
  [README](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/blob/main/README.md), but repeated
  here: `=`, `\``, `^`, `#`, `|`, `:`, `/`, `[` and `]`. `$` is supported, but
  not recommended, as it might intefere with the KaTeX math delimiters.

## 0.3.3 (2021-08-24)

### New features

- New front matter field: Use the `date` (string) field to add a date to the
  note. The datestring must comply with
  [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), with seconds and timezone
  being optional. If no timezone is specified, the local timezone will be used,
  though the timezone information is not utilized at the moment.

### Enhancements

- You are now able to use [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) in the front matter, if
  that suits your fancy.
- The
  [`IndexPreprocessor`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/blob/master/src/preprocess/index.rs)
  bundled with mdBook is improved for mdzk and now replaces all links to
  `README.md` into `index.md`. This means you can use the Markdown convention of
  naming the main page README without having broken links/backlinks.


## 0.3.2 (2021-08-13)

### Bug fixes

- Once again fixed a hot-reloading loop caused by tracking changes on the
  summmary file.


## 0.3.1 (2021-08-13)

### Enhancements

- Prettier log messages. There should be a lot less verbosity when running mdzk
  now.


## 0.3.0 (2021-08-12)

### Breaking changes

- mdzk now has a set of defined global variables for the directory tree:

    - Source directory: `notes`
    - Build directory: `html`
    - (!) Config file: `mdzk.toml`
    - (!) Summary file: `.mdzk_summary.md` (located within the source directory)

    You will (sadly) have to change the files marked with (!) manually for the
    new version of mdzk to work.

    The advantage of hiding the summary file is that Obsidian users can enjoy
    their graph view without it being ruined by one monolithic `SUMMARY.md`
    node.

### Enhancements

- `mdzk init` produces a directory tree completely according to the above
  specification. It does not pollute this tree with any default files like
  mdBook's `chapter_1.md`.
- We (hopefully) now use better HTML escaping, which means characters like `"`,
  `'` and `&` should be safer to use.

### Bug fixes

- Both wikilinks and backlinks now use relative paths, which means they should
  be completely functional regardless of how nested your notes are or how the
  vault is published.


## 0.2.4 (2021-08-10)

Sporting the newest additions to `mdbook-wikilink` and `mdbook-backlinks`.

### New features

- Disable default processors with the `disable_default_processors` option.


## 0.2.3 (2021-08-09)

### Bug fixes

- `mdzk serve` did not load the correct config, nor update the `SUMMARY.md` file
  on file changes. This is now fixed.


## 0.2.2 (2021-08-06)

### New features

- added the flags `port` and `bind` to the `serve` subcommand
  (<https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/commit/033c071c9cf2a4855707a3ec0db0a612a82601ab>)
