**mdzk** is a plain text Zettelkasten system that is based on the [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) API. It consists of specialized preprocessors for handling key features such as [[Wikilinks|wikilinks]], [[Backlinks|backlinks]] and [[Front matter|front matter]], all tied together in the mdzk CLI. mdzk allows you to use whatever text editor you prefer - be it [[Obsidian]], [[Vim and Neovim|Vim]], [[Visual Studio Code]] or even [[Emacs|Notepad]]. You can view your notes with live updating as you edit them, have them automatically published to GitHub Pages on push and much more.
