# Douglas R. Hofstadter
While he has been in the public light for decades, my first concentrated exposure to Hofstadter was his 2009 Presidential Lecture: [[2009 🗣 Analogy as Core - Hofstadter]]. It's clear he's a fun and fascinating thinker. 

### Wiki
Douglas Richard Hofstadter is an American scholar of cognitive science, physics, and comparative literature whose research includes concepts such as the sense of self in relation to the external world, consciousness, analogy-making, artistic creation, literary translation, and discovery in mathematics and physics. 

His 1979 book *Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid* won both the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction and a National Book Award (at that time called The American Book Award) for Science.
