# Ptolemy
Ptolemy was a Greek guy living in Alexandria, Egypt, where the biggest library in the world was. 

And so what did Ptolemy do? He read...and he looked at the stars a lot. 

All that reading and all that staring at the stars led to something massive. He assembled and created a unified theory of the cosmos called [[150 📚 The Almagest]]. This text was so good, it was treated as 100% accurate for 1500 years!  

Even after [[Copernicus]] published his heliocentric theory in 1543, it took another century until [[Kepler]] overcame his deeply ingrained beliefs. [[Kepler didn't think outside the box, he thought outside the circle]].

### The Ptolemic System
![[geocentric.jpg]]
The geocentric model of Plato could not explain the retrograde motion of the planets. Around 140 A.D. Ptolemy proposed his refined geocentric model. In the Ptolemaic universe, a planet moves in a small circle called an epicycle, and the center of the epicycle moves along a larger circle around the Earth. The centers of the epicycles of Mercury and Venus must lie on the line joining the Earth and the Sun. Stars are fixed on an outermost sphere.

This model gives predictions on the positions of the planets within a few degrees from the actual positions. This was generally accepted and the Ptolemaic model dominated the western world for 1500 years. It was, in fact, superior to the Copernican system proposed in the 16th century. Although Copernicus idea that the earth rotates around the sun was correct he still assumed that the planets move in perfect circles, instead of ellipses. Therefore the Copernican system predicted the positions of the planets less precisely than the *incorrect* geocentric model of Ptolemy.

Claudius Ptolemy was a mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, geographer and astrologer who wrote several scientific treatises, three of which were of importance to later Byzantine, Islamic and Western European science.

Ptolemy inherited from his Greek predecessors a geometrical toolbox and a partial set of models for predicting where the planets would appear in the sky. Apollonius of Perga (c. 262 – c. 190 BC) had introduced the deferent and epicycle and the eccentric deferent to astronomy. Hipparchus (2nd century BC) had crafted mathematical models of the motion of the Sun and Moon. Hipparchus had some knowledge of Mesopotamian astronomy, and he felt that Greek models should match those of the Babylonians in accuracy. He was unable to create accurate models for the remaining five planets. 

The Syntaxis adopted Hipparchus' solar model, which consisted of a simple eccentric deferent. For the Moon, Ptolemy began with [Hipparchus]' *epicycle-on-deferent*, then added a device that historians of astronomy refer to as a "*crank mechanism*":[11] He succeeded in creating models for the other planets, where Hipparchus had failed, by introducing a third device called the *equant*.

#### Life & Times:
Ptolemy lived and worked mainly in Alexandria, Egypt, where he set up an observatory on the top floor of a temple and made astronomical observations from around 125 to 150.  It is likely that he worked at the Alexandrine Library and Museion, the research institution where the famous Greek geometers, Apollonius of Perga and [work related to] Euclid* had studied and taught.  One of its directors, Eratosthenes measured the size of the Earth correct to within 50 miles.

At the library, Ptolemy would have had available the entire accumulated wealth of information compiled by Greek scholars over the previous four centuries.  It can be assumed that the research he completed in the library, together with his own observations, provided the basis for his great work, the “Almagest,”  the first attempt to provide a systematic treatment of the whole of mathematical astronomy.   It became a brilliant tool for instruction on many topics and encompassed everything from basic principles to complex mathematical explanations.  In the work Ptolemy described the motion of the Sun, Moon and planets and their related phenomena, and provided a mathematical model.  He also offered a guide to the use of these tables, using numerical parameters from observational data. When appropriate he also described the construction of the observational instruments used.

Ptolemy researched works by other astronomers and scholars like Hipparchus and Aristarchos in order to create the Ptolemaic system:  a geocentric scheme for the universe.  Some of the scholars he studied had already proposed a heliocentric solar system but Ptolemy wrongly followed the views of [followed views of] Aristotle*.  The “Almagest” was published in 150 CE, under its Greek title of  “He Mathematike Syntaxis” (“The Mathematical Collection”) but it soon become known as “The Great Compilation.”   Years later, in the 9th century, Islamic scholars like [translated by] Al-Farghani* started translating Greek works into Arabic and “The Great Compilation” became “al-majisti” (“The Greatest”),  or (in the West: “Almagest”).  From Arabic the work was translated into Latin,  Ptolemy’s ideas soon reached Western Europe.

The “Almagest” is made up of thirteen different books dealing with various astronomical concepts.  In the first book, he reasoned that if Earth’s gravity drew everything towards its centre, then this was also true for the celestial bodies around the Earth.  This brought him to support Aristotle’s theory that Earth was at the centre of the cosmos with everything orbiting it.  The Ptolemaic system assumed that all orbits were circular but not necessarily with Earth at the centre of them.  Ptolemy worked on the basis that the orbits of Mercury, Venus and Mars were epicyclical.  This means that a planet was orbiting a point which, itself, was orbiting the Earth.

In the second book Ptolemy noted that the planets were much closer to the Earth than the "fixed" stars, and he seems to have believed in the physical existence of eight nested crystalline rotating spheres.   Seven of these each carried one heavenly bodies.  The fixed stars were carried on the eighth.  The spheres were moved by the “prime mover.”    This system became dogma in Western Christendom until the 16th century, when it was replaced by the heliocentric system of the Polish astronomer [theory superseded by] Copernicus*.

In the third book, Ptolemy observed solstices and equinoxes which meant that he could predict the length of the seasons and design a model for the Sun, showing it moving in a circular motion of uniform velocity.  He found that the Earth was not in fact in the centre of the circle, but at a distance to one side, called the “eccentricity.”   Books four and five contained his theory of his theory of the Moon.  Ptolemy explained three periods of lunar motion (the times taken for it to return to the same longitude, velocity and latitude).  He explained Hipparchus’ epicycle model for the Moon, but noted that there were discrepancies between the model and what could actually be seen.

Now that he had explained the motion of the Sun and the Moon, Ptolemy went on to apply these motions to create a theory of eclipses, which he described in book six.   Books seven and eight concentrated mainly on the fixed stars which, Ptolemy believed, always kept the same positions relative to each other.  Here, Ptolemy included a catalogue of over a thousand stars.

Up to this point, Ptolemy based his work on ideas researched from his predecessors, but in the last five books of the “Almagest,” he discussed his own planetary theory.  This involved a highly complicated model which explained observational data and which had not been available before his time.   This was a geocentric system in which the Earth was at the centre of the universe with the planets moving in a circle around it. He produced a graphic representation in which large circles (called “deferents”)  represented the planets. Each deferent traveled round the circumference of a smaller circle, called an “epicycle,” (whose centre revolved on the deferent).

According to Ptolemy, this model provided the basis for mathematical computations that would explain all the strange things astronomers observed, such as the way the brightness of the planets waxed and waned, and the way in which they appeared to stop moving, or go backwards and forwards in a loop (like Mars).  The speed of the planetary movements also seemed to vary and Ptolemy dealt with this anomaly by creating an imaginary point in the sky called the “equant” from where the speed could be seen to be steady and circular. 

Most of the tables that Ptolemy scattered throughout the “Almagest” were published under the title “Handy Tables,” which he updated when new data became available.  He also wrote “Planetary Hypothesis,” which replaced his geometrical theories with mechanical ones, aimed at readers who could not grasp mathematical computations.

Another of Ptolemy's major works, the “Guide to Geography,” mapped out the known world, gave the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates of major locations and showed how to construct maps using projective geometry which would eventually become the basis for the Renaissance use of perspective.  Even as late as 1775, everybody also believed Ptolemy’s early claim that a southern continent bounded the Indian Ocean, until [influenced] Cook* returned from the Southern Hemisphere having failed to find an Antarctic continent. 

“Optica” was Ptolemy’s next work, in which he discussed color, reflection, refraction and mirrors of various shapes.  This was probably based on the refraction of light from celestial bodies he observed at different altitudes.   This led him to discuss the change in direction of light when it passes obliquely from a medium of one density into another.  It was the first recorded attempt at a solution to this observational problem and was later taken up and explained by the great 11th-century Arabic mathematician, [influenced] Al Hazen*.

[[1978 🎬 Connections - An Alternative View of Change (James Burke)#Episode 2 - Death in the Morning]]

"Death in the Morning" examines the standardization of precious metal with the touchstone in the ancient world. This innovation stimulated trade from Greece to Persia, ultimately causing the construction of a huge commercial center and library at Alexandria which included Ptolemy's star tables. This wealth of astronomical knowledge aided navigators 14 centuries later after the development of lateen sails and sternpost rudders.
