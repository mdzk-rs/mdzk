# 1940 - Don't Quit - Edgar A.
### Don't Quit
When things go wrong as they sometimes will,
When the road you're trudging seems all up hill,
When the funds are low and the debts are high
And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,
When care is pressing you down a bit,
Rest if you must, but don't you quit.
Life is queer with its twists and turns,
As every one of us sometimes learns,
And many a failure turns about
When he might have won had he stuck it out;
Don't give up though the pace seems slow--
You may succeed with another blow,
Success is failure turned inside out--
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,
And you never can tell how close you are,
It may be near when it seems so far;
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit--
It's when things seem worst that you must not quit.

- Edgar A. Guest

### Notes
I kinda don't like having this in here, but it's just a placeholder for showing how to handle a source "poem". It's short, so it's not too shabby to just paste the whole thing in.

I suppose if I had to force a link here, I'll refer you to a place where quitting often happens: the [[Mental Squeeze Point]].
