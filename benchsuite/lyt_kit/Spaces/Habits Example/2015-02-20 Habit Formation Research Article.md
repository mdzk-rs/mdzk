Neurons that fire together wire together. Passing mental states become lasting neural traits

Portraits of the mind Carl Schoonover showed pictures and showed how dendrites grow spines for better connections better a dendrite to a axon (or to synapses (confirm "better" connections with Ray). [add ideas of cofactors, an increased neural connection

Habit formation is additive.

[One theory Ray has, Axons sends a neurotransmitter (a chemical) to dendrites across a synapse, where the neurotransmitter is broken down (maybe a chemical reaction of some kind), then the result is the bouton (a cell filled with chemicals), which resides on the spines of dendrites which receive the signal. HAS THE SCIENCE GOTTEN THERE YET?

Carl also showed video showing neural networks forming. Now more than ever, we are starting to witness the neural formation of habits.

Fredickson's broaden and build theory (maybe use, need to show the relationship between the power and clarity of the negative emotions and the softer more nuanced aspects of the positive emotions.

Use her 10 positive emotions as a quick framework to reference.

Rick hanson's recommendation is simple and powerful. Cementing powerful emotions. [Ray asked is there a relationship between time and when you reflect?]
Change your mind to change your brain to change your mind.

My contribution: A habit has always been so fascinating to me. A habit is a mirror, it gives what you give it, and what you were given is what you'll give. It's the immediate expression of the law of cause and effect. Just like newtons law of conservation states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction; so with habits are that for every action, taking the same action again will require less effort. And all things being equal, our unconscious behavior defaults to the easier pathway.

[Show the correlation to skill development and sporting applications. the first 80% comes faster than the last 20%]

Neural connections were made and repeated actions optimize them. They become more efficient. We can only surmise as to why, but to me it has clear evolutionary advantages. Any action we take burns calories and uses either our physical muscles, our mental muscles (like the anterior cingulate cortex, which is a crucial player in willpower management), or both. By making a repeated action easier, less energy is used, less willpower is required (less [define:]cognitive resources), and fewer calories are burned—all of which lead to a better chance of survival.

Now we just need to survive everyday stress by ...

**The Asymptotic Curve**: Understanding Habits & Expertise through Memory & Strength Training Disciplines

The same asymptotic curve that correlates with habit formation also appears with becoming an expert at something. See Ericsson 1993.

To leap to a new level of development beyond the plateau, we must get out of our newly established Automatic Mindset, and return to a Beginner's "Cognitive" Mindset. That's how to breakthrough the plateau.

Connect the Asymptotic Curve shown in this study with Joshua Foer's coined phrase of the "OK Plateau."

[The OK Plateau is a good phrase. I could say the "Good enough plateau," but that's not good enough. The curve shows a plateau and vernacular understands what a plateau is—so I might just have to use it.]

Russian Conjugate Periodization shows the same curve for the physical development of Olympic athletes. Evolving the routine forces the muscles into their own form of "cognitive thinking."

A key term here is "adaption." Explore Tom Mysklinski's article to put it into context [search: "adapt]

A general rule of thumb is that training shifts should happen around every 4-6 weeks (verify ((also, does this connect with habit formation in any way))).

It's related to the principle that the final 10% of the task takes as long as the prior 90%. (Fighting Perfectionism)

The Law of Diminishing Returns also follows the same pattern.

Our attention spans also follow this curve without the addition of something novel.

Perhaps becoming an expert can be summarized by phrase used by the US Marine Corps, Viggo Mortensen, and Clint Eastwood: “Adapt and Overcome."

Then, it’s just about knowing what to overcome… [segue to Amateur's Quest]
