# The neural formation of habits is additive 
I attended a presentation of "Portraits of the Mind" by Carl Schoonover. He showed pictures of how dendrites grow spines for better connections to synapses. Carl showed a video of neural networks forming. 

Now more than ever, we are starting to witness the neural formation of habits—and it is physically additive, while being calorically subtractive. In this sense, [[Newton's Laws of Motion|Newton's Law of Inertia]] is poetically upheld.
