# Workflows MOC
As I engage with the world of ideas, what are my "best practice" workflows for processing all that stuff? [[2021-03-02]]

### Preface
- I'm going to focus as little as possible on the technical aspects of workflows. They are the most fragile and least evergreen, and yet too many people spend too many days trying to construct the most perfect workflow, which has several dependencies, and the second one of those dependencies goes out of date, the whole workflow crumbles.

### Don't forget the big questions
- *What are your use cases again? Your goals?*
- *What are your biggest sticking points? Are they really?*

### What are my workflow rules
- Separate the *noise* from the *signal* (see: [[Signal to Noise Ratio]]).
	- Remember, just because you can capture everything, doesn't mean you should.
- Strictly limit commenting and organizing in the noise.
	- Highlighting is okay. For research papers as PDFs, commenting is okay too.
- Use a system of filters to add friction to curate the noise.
- Practice [[Idea Emergence]] and don't create unearned notes.
- Try to minimize note-taking so I can maximize note-making.

### What is my main workflow philosophy
Practice "radical idea emergence". Don't save that much. With the stuff you do save, don't schedule a time to process it. If it's really important it can't help but reveal its importance over time (from the nothingness, it enters the "somethingness"). Then create a new note and develop it. (There are exceptions, like when it's helpful to assemble a pre-made map.)

### Where am I encountering new things?
- Web articles; Youtube videos; Podcasts
- People online; People in real life
- Books; Movies
- Research papers
- Notions
- Internal thoughts


### How am I practicing Idea Emergence as I encounter new things?
1. *How am I reducing the amount of information I encounter?* 
	- *Does everything have free reign to assault your senses at all times?*
2. *How am I filtering the quality of the information I encounter?*
	- *How are you vetting the ideas you come across?*
	- *How can you raise the standards on your vetting of information?* 
3. *What steps do random bits of information go through before they enter my note-making space?*
	- *Where is there good friction in this part of my system?*

## My common workflows
### Processing from the web
**Prompts**: *Where am I encountering information? What do I want to do with it?*

- *What am I using to save stuff?* 
	- Bookmarks, Pocket, Drafts
- *What am I not using but could?* 
	- Evernote, Zotero, DevonThink, Are.na
- *How does the workflow work?*
	- Find something interesting, save it to Pocket.
	- Maybe remember to check Pocket at some point.
- *What would you like to change in the future?*
	- I'd like to ditch Pocket and get DevonThink rolling. That way I can save documents in an offline format that is easier to organize, use, and future-proof. But this'll take some time and I'm in no rush... UPDATE: Not so sure about investing energy into DevonThink. 


### Processing a book (and other big things)
**Prompts**: *Why am I reading it? If it's mostly for enjoyment, maybe I shouldn't process it (other than to mark something here or there). How much time do I want to spend on this book? Do I want to skim it or devour it?*

Assuming it's a book I've identified as high-value—and it's a book I actually want to process (instead of just enjoy), then do the following:
- Create a new note using [[Template for Book 📚]].
- From the web, copy and paste the table of contents. It's a pre-made, pre-vetted map. Use it as a lattice for quotes and notes.


### Processing a research paper PDF
**Prompts**: *Why am I reading it? What do I want to do with it?

- Save the PDF in Zotero.
- Make highlights in the PDF.
- Use zotfile to extract highlights.
- Use mdnotes to extract highlights as markdown (with working links).
	- Only do this when needed.

### Processing a movie
**Prompts**: *What resonated with me?

### Processing a notion
**Prompts**: *What resonated with me? How am I adding friction to this notions I encounter?

- Capture with Drafts
	- Then the dance between Nothingness and Somethingness begins
		- Either push it to my note-making space
		- Or leave it alone
			- Forever?
				- Maybe, or until you're reminded of it, then maybe it's worth pushing into my note-making space

### Processing from the inside-out
**Prompt**: *Maybe I should just type it out?? Have I considered a daily note? ...an unstructured place to throw my thoughts and words, where I can link out to new notes?*

- Use a Daily Note for journaling
	- Link out as needed
- Use a Timestamped note for things you might want to track: meetings, meals, workouts, conversations
	- Link out as needed
