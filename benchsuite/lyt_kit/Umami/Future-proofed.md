[[Evergreen notes are antifragile]]
# Future-proofed
Much can be said about future-proofing your notes. In short: be aware of how software is locking you in. And don't trust exporters, there is little incentive for the companies to allow you to export perfectly out of their software (ie Evernote), although customers are demanding that now and there are many good players like Bear and Obsidian, but in general don't expose yourself to the risk.
