# Seasons
The seasons are a natural example of ying and yang...ebb and flow...It's usually a duality but it doesn't have to be a duality. Many things are cyclical: the seasons, perennials, period's for women, the moon, hunger and satiation...

Other things may be cyclical and also be in stages, like how Hermann Hesse's characters (Siddhartha, Joseph Knecht) go through their different stages of life, similar to the idea of the stages of personal development (dependence, independence, interdependence), which both can map to the xy graph for progression overload—the idea behind building muscular strength through culmulative cycles. 
- pre-industrial metaphor = grow
- post-industrial metaphor = make... ie: everyday speech: we make time, make friends, make meaning, make money, make a living, make love.
    - Alan Watts observed that a Chinese child will ask, "How does a baby grow?" But an American child will ask, "How do you make a baby?"

### Somebody's decent quote about seasons
 *The notion that our lives are like the eternal cycle of the seasons does not deny the struggle or the joy, the loss or the gain, the darkness or the light, but encourages us to embrace it all-and to find in all of it opportunities for growth.*
From an early age, we absorb our culture's arrogant conviction that we manufacture everything, reducing the world to mere "raw material" that lacks all value until we impose our designs and labor on it.”
― abbrev. quote from Parker J. Palmer, Let Your Life Speak: Listening for the Voice of Vocation
