### Definitions
Let's define some overlapping conceptual categories:
-   [[Concepts MOC|Concepts]]: A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism recognized and given a name.
-   **Mental Models** are specific readily-available patterns or mechanisms that—*when applied to a current situation or thing*—allow for efficient, optimal action. Great for strategic agency and in-the-moment adaptability.
-   **Metaphors** are primarily for relating unlike things. Great for creative expression and a means unto itself.
-   [[Refraction Thinking]] are primarily for broadening perspective and deepening understanding. Great for reviewing, planning, empathizing, and meditating.
