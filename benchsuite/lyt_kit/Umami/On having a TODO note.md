# On having a TODO note
Usually, the people who are "Daily Notes" practitioners also like tagging their entries with `[[TODO]]` or `#task`. I recommend using a different app to fully manage your projects and tasks.

But if you won't be deterred, here is a way to handle tasks in markdown.

- `[[TODO]]` - Use this to manage your tasks
- `#task` - Use a tag like this if you don't want to rely on backlinks to surface tasks or muddy up your graph with task-related connections.
- `[[done]]` - Change `[[TODO]]` to `[[done]]` if you care about keeping a log the stuff you've completed.

Just to reiterate, I prefer to not clutter my ideas with tasks. Ideas are built for long-term value; whereas tasks provide very short-term value. Also, [[people who are led by a task manager cut off their intuition]].
