# Vulnerability
*I am uncertain and emotionally exposed*

Vulnerability is “uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure.”[^1] The word Vulnerability is derived from the Latin word vulnerare, meaning “to wound.” The definition includes “capable of being wounded: and “open to attack or damage.” On the other hand, weakness is defined as the “inability to withstand attack or wounding.”[^2] 

Vulnerability is based on mutuality and requires boundaries and trust. It’s not oversharing, it’s not purging, it’s not indiscrimintate disclosure, and it’s not social media information dumping. Vulnerability is about sharing our feelings and our experiences with people who have earned the right to hear them. Being vulnerable and open is mutual and an integral part of the trust-building process.

> “Until we can receive with an open heart, we are never really giving with an open heart. When we attach judgment to receiving help, we knowingly or unknowingly attach judgment to giving help.” [^3]

Learning how to lean into the discomfort of uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure is a painful but rewarding process. So is saying “no” to your friends and acquaintances You may be terrified that you will piss off a friend or squander a professional opportunity. Try saying saying more often. You might find that you don’t regret it. Nothing may transform your life more than realizing that it’s a waste of time to evaluate your worthiness by weighing the reaction of the people in the stands.

Vulnerability is the bridge to authenticity / emotions / and connection. Vulnerability is strength. Vulnerability equals courage. <!--which equals “Leap” on the Amateur’s Quest)-->
