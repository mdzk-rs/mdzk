Sometimes the best way of understanding something is hearing what people have to say about it. 

*What is a zettelkasten, in 10 seconds?*

> You link every idea to every other idea, so that eventually you start to find associations you weren't intentionally looking for, and it begins to create new ideas. - @mediapathic

> It's a second/external brain. You using it - doubles up as learning. - @sigod

> Make your notes (ideas), as singular/specific/atomic as possible, densely link them (with links, tags, metadata, timestamps, attributes, relations, etc), in order to create a web of connections. Allows for easy retrieval of info, less things lost, and biggest of all, seeing connections, associations and patterns you couldn't otherwise and the serendipity of finding/coming across notes/ideas you didn't think were related. - @animeking527

> The idea is to stress linking rather than folders/hierarchy - @kllian
		
> zk is not primarily for storage/recall but for creating a representation of networked thought you can interact with. - @ambient complexity

> zettelkasten = small notes written by you and connecting by themes. @Abdulla

> A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing that creates an interconnected web of thought. Its emphasis is on connection and not mere collection of ideas. - zettelkasten.de
