# Fluid Taxonomies
Fluid Taxonomies is a term coined by user "mediapathic", which came up in our conversations about MOCs and other ways of managing knowledge.

*[These taxonomies] are useful abstractions, ways of arranging information to provide paths for specific purposes*.

*All of them have *advantages and disadvantages*. Most notably, all of them fail to give you the serendipity of search that most [zettlekasten] options traditionally have. Which is fine, depending on what you're trying to do.*

*Make sure you keep in mind that whatever taxonomy you're using is not True, it's just a tool.*

*It occurs to me, another way of thinking about this is that you're applying hierarchies, like a file system directory tree, but they're being applied in such a way that does not limit the data to staying in those hierarchies.*

*[Consider] the metaphor of a functioning collective. You put a hierarchy in place (like an MOC), for as long as it's useful. And then when it's not useful, the members of that hierarchy rearrange their power structure to suit the new purpose.*

Then to summarize the conversation, mediapathic riffed on the Discordian quote:
