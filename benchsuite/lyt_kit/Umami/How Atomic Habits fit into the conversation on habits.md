# How Atomic Habits fit into the conversation on habits
Atomic Habits is a term from James Clear, with a book of the same name. 

Here's a summary of his argument:
- Winners and losers can have the same goals, so what actually makes the difference? The system and process. Yep, makes me this of my ode to The Process, see [[Trust the Process]].
- Habits are the fundamental unit of your systems. Your current systems are perfectly designed to provide you with your current results.

James adds a fourth step to Duhigg's habit cycle, which was needed. James is a smart dude. Check out the steps here: [[Understanding the habit cycle and habitual cues]].

Other tidbits:
- The first step is Awareness. Discover and record your habits throughout the day. Here's an example of me [[Charting out habit cycles in my life circa 2013]]
	- The more specific the implementation, the more motivation, ie time, place, etc
- Focus on Identity over Outcome: ie "I'm the guy who..." over thinking about the result I want...Every action you take is you casting a vote for your identity.
- James shares 'The Goldilocks rule', which is nothing more than finding [[Flow]] through balancing challenge with ability, which apparently is 3-4% beyond your current ability. You need victories to stay satisfied, but you need to be challenged.

Ah yes, "novelty". Reminds me of how [[Our brain's attentional filter responds to Importance and Novelty]].
