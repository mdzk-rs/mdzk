# Figuring out your Home MOCs
Your MOCs in your Home note are just your main categories of personal knowledge. They should be broad. At first, you'll probably only need 2-3. Try to stay below 10 or so. They are easy to change and rename to your heart's content. All the prep work is done for you. Just copy the below text and paste it in a new "Home" note.

```
- 01 - [[Mindsets MOC]]
- 02 - [[Writings MOC]] 
- 03 - [[Concepts MOC]]
- 04 - [[Interests MOC]]
- 05 - [[Sources MOC]]
- 06 - [[People MOC]]
- 07 - [[Health MOC]]
- 08 - [[Goals MOC]]
- 09 - [[Projects MOC]]
- 10 - [[PKM MOC]]
```

### How to Customize your main MOCs in your Home note
It's easy, if you want to change "Sources" to "Habits", you would just delete `[[Sources MOC]]` from your Home note (don't worry, that note still exists elsewhere), and replace it with `[[Habits MOC]]`.

Boom.

That's it. 

Well, what are you waiting for, develop your own home note now!
