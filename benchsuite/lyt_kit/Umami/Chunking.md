# Chunking
*It takes years of focused reps to chunk like an expert.*

Something tells me Tom Brady and Cam Newton see different things. Cam Newton might be 11 defenders. Something tells me Tom Brady sees larger movements and patterns in the defense that he can't even articulate—but he sees them and makes the right read. 

That's how chunking intersects with expertise, intuition, and [[Deliberate Practice]]. Speaking more to [[K. Anders Ericsson]]'s work with chess masters, Ericsson noticed that chess masters retrieved knowledge from long term memory around meaningful game patterns that novices did not see or understand. It takes years of focused reps to chunk like an expert.

In [[Douglas R. Hofstadter]]'s speech [[2009 🗣 Analogy as Core - Hofstadter]], he says (paraphrased):

### George A. Miller
George A. Miller, one of the top scientists of the 20th century, in his classic 1956 paper, "[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]]," coined the terms "working memory" and "chunking."  He discovered that the number of digits people could hold in mind before their memory overloaded was remarkably consistent across all people.  So pervasive was this number that his famous article opened with, “My problem is that I’ve been persecuted by an integer.”

### Wiki
"In cognitive psychology, chunking is a process by which individual pieces of an information set are broken down and then grouped together in a meaningful whole. 

The chunks by which the information is grouped is meant to improve short-term retention of the material, thus bypassing the limited capacity of working memory."
