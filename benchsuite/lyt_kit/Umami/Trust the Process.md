# Trust the Process
When I was young, my dad said we could open presents a day early if we solved his riddle. I chewed on the riddle trying to solve it. It was riveting to have a good riddle. 

Then my brother emerged from the computer room (having just been on the internet) and he blurted out the answer. You'd think I would have been happy to open presents; but instead I was disappointed because I was robbed of a juicy riddle. 

It's not the answer, it's the riddle itself that matters. Or put another way, the riddle IS the answer. It's a means unto itself, full of its own joy and fulfillment. *The Process is Fulfilling.*

The Process forces us to think critically, categorize ideas, relate them to similar ideas, come up with metaphors/analogies/stories to better convey those ideas. *The Process improves Thinking.*

The Process solidifies thoughts you deem worthy of remembering, and by working The Process, you strengthen the ability to recall those worthy things in your life. *The Process strengthens Memory.*

Most importantly, it's not the destination but the journey. Or put another way, the journey IS the destination. 

***Trust the Process. The Process is the Answer.***
