### My notes
Captivity, compression, collision... concentration, density, tightly-packed

light, spark, explode, electricity, lightning, illumination

> The tightly-packed collision of clouds produces intense electricity in the form of lightning; and from lightning comes illumination. The same is true for ideas.

Over at [[MOCs are Dialectics]], we continue marinating in this pressure cooker of thought.
