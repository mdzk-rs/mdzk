# Evergreen notes maximize optionality
A second-order effect that results from "linking your thinking" is how much "Optionality" it offers. 

Simply put, optionality is not feeling stuck.

It enhances the value you have at your fingertips. It allows you to work from a place of abudance, as opposed to a place of scarcity. And it aids in your ability to pivot your career at the drop of a hat (or the onset of a pandemic!).

Personally, I've leaned on experiences from coaching college football and working as civil engineer to entrepreneurship and filmmaking. I've parlayed hard-earned patterns in one field of thought—systematizing and maintaining a small business—into a completely different one—like editing in television. 

A large part of this ability stems from not just having quality experiences in my life, but in being able to re-apply fundamental aspects of those past experiences to new situations.
