# Resiliency Routines help regain a sense of control
Life happens. Sometimes we're on top of the world, other times the world is on top of us. Around May 2018, the world was on top of me. I felt an instinctual pull to rebuild some routine and structure into my day. Due to my undiagonosed condition to nounify everything, I began to refer to these practices as *Resiliency Routines*. Others who have read Duhigg might refer to them as "Keystone Habits"[^1]. Normal people might just say "things I do in the morning and at night." 

For me, in the briefest rendition, it just meant waking up earlier than normal, journaling, and working out. I had one unfair super tool in my arsenal: access to a sauna. So every morning resulted in a sauna-workout. 

In the sauna one morning I recognized that I was: *unhappy, unbalanced, and unproductive*. My morning trifecta—wake early, journal, and workout—helped remove the “un” from those prefixes. 

1. Wake early
2. Journal
3. Workout

This is a simple reminder that the solution to not feeling so overwhelmed starts with some simple actions.
