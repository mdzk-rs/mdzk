# Forge evergreen notes in a process called note-making

 This process delivers a built-in mechanism for:
 
 1. idea creation and connection
 2. the strengthening of note retrieval
 3. the productive/clever use of spaced repetition

Let's do a step by step walkthrough of the evergreen note-making process.

### A note-making walkthrough
- I pulled in this old note from my pre-Obsidian zettelkasten. 
	- [[2015-02-20 Habit Concepts and Theory]]
- It's rough and less useful than it could be.
- I made a new note to work in, and eventually it became this:
	- [[The neural formation of habits is additive - v1]]
- Now I have an evergreen note.
- Can you see why the second note is so much for valuable?
- Because now I can return to this note and add more valuable to it over time. That's what I did. A few days later, I returned to that note and developed it further:
	- [[The neural formation of habits is additive]]
- "Wait a second!" You say. "Where did most of it go?"
- That's the beauty. Through the the evergreen *note-making* process, I realized my note was actually trying to say many different things. 
- And since I wanted to be able to link to each idea separately, I made them into separate evergreen notes. Here's the other one:
	- [[The truest habit metaphors are additive]]
- But wait there's more! This process actually encouraged me to create more notes and link these ideas to other ideas. (This is crazy powerful). Suddenly, I couldn't believe what I put together:
	- [[Habit formation provides an evolutionary advantage]]
	- [[Habits carry a ton of hidden inertia]]
- Those are powerful notes!
- Creating one evergreen note oftentimes spawns new insights for more evergreen notes.
- And that's the power of forging evergreen notes in the process known as **Note-Making**.

Boom! That's it.

### Evergreen notes lead to MOCs
But that's seriously just the beginning, because now I want to introduce you to the most revolutionary thinking tool in the "Age of the Linked Note"!

What am I even talking about here?  

I'm talking about **Maps of Content**—also known as MOCs.

You simple must go through the [[The 3 Phases of MOCs]] to learn more about how to enhance your *note-making* using MOCs.

Before you click that link though, let's finish the big picture. 

- See at the top of this note, how I have a link that leads back to the [[LYT Kit]]? 
- I like to make sure that my MOC notes are somehow linked back to my Home note.
- In this case, it's simple:
	- This note, [[Forge evergreen notes]], leads back to [[LYT Kit]]...
	- ...which leads back to [[PKM MOC]], which is one of my ≈10 main MOCs, and it leads back to...
	- ...you guessed it!
	- It leads back to the [[+Home]] note!
	- That means that very simply, I've created a star map where I can make hyperspace jumps between different levels of "Idea Emergence" in just a few clicks.
	- Pretty awesome in my opinion.

Okay, you should click on that MOC link now. Here it is again: [[The 3 Phases of MOCs]].
