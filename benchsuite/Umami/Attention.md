# Attention
Attention is what the mind is focused on—and what it has been focused on over the recent past (the past 72 hours is simple way to look at it). Everything that enters the mind in the past 72 hours affects the next hour of thought. That's what it's so important to Guard and Guide Your Mind wisely.

Guard what enters your mind, and what stays in the mind. Reduce distractions. Reduce attentional switching.

### Subsets of Attention

- **Focus** — The ability to maintain focus is of crucial importance in any aspect of modern living. Without focus, life drifts from stimuli to stimuli, with very little consistent [[Direction]].
- **Residual Attention** — Your *attention* isn't just about what you are thinking about right now; it's moreso composed of everything that's entered your mind over past 72 hours.
