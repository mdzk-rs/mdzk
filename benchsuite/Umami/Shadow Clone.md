Shadow clones can serve a number of purposes: They can be used as decoys, either by keeping opponents preoccupied or, because they can't be told apart, concealing the original's identity. Shadow clones can also be used simply to assist the user, joining the user for tactics they can't do alone.

Shadow clones can also accelerate training periods. For example, by training alongside one shadow clone for one hour, the user will have two hours' worth of training experience once the shadow clone disperses.
