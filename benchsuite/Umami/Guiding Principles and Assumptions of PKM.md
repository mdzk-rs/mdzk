### Guiding Principles and Assumptions
1. The more ways you can access a note, the better chance you have of retrieving it.  Can I find it when I want it?
2. The more contexts a note has, the better the chance you have of discovering it. Can I stumble upon it?
3. Most notes should try to not go longer than a page. Long notes say many things. Therefore, when you link to a long note, your link isn't as clear. Confusion can result from the vagueness. 
	- Some people are rigid in their thinking that "one idea should equal one note". I'm much more relaxed and "Laissez Faire" about this.
4. Making connections between notes fosters new insights, enhances note retrieval, and improves our understanding of the linked notes.
5. Getting repetitions in our library improves our memory. 
6. A digital library should make sense and be useable to someone else—including and especially your Future Self.
