# Evergreen notes maximize reusability
As the number of your evergreen notes grows over time, their value compounds into a priceless amalgamation of modular, agile thought-units. 

This becomes apparent as you start making more domain-lateral connections. As you develop this ability—and enough time passed—you'll see how the same evergreen note can contribute to multiple projects over time. That's long-term reusable value.

It's worth noting that evergreen notes take more effort to write than regular notes, but they act as a reusable, evolving, and ever-contributing library of valuable insights that you take with you throughout your life—across projects, careers, and decades.
