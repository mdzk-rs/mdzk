# Why Categories for Your Notes are a *Good* Idea
The idea that "categories are bad" hinges on a faulty notion that categories limit access and cause rigidity that inhibit organic thinking.

That argument applies to a system of folders. It does not apply to more fluid structures. Let's explore...

**Argument 1**
Creating categories is a top-down process. You start with the structure and then file the material away. Notes will have to fit the structure. If they don’t, there’ll have to be a compromise. [^1]

**Counter**
If a categorizing framework is set up to be fluid, it is not top down. Notes do not have to fit its structure. There is no compromise. In the case of a Home note, it's a pre-existing structure that you can tether to only when you care to. *It adds context without limiting access.* 

Here is that same picture: Wolverine is the note, and your Home note is just another tether:

**Argument 2**
Static categories are rigid. Our brains are not rigid. Therefore static categories inhibit our knowledge from growing organically.

**Counter**
This is still assuming that "categories equal top-down oppressive hierarchies."But with Maps of Content (MOCs), it's quite the opposite. MOCs spring up organically as the need arises for them. An example is this kit's note called: [[LYT Kit]]; I didn't start with that; I instinctually grasped for it once I felt I had too many notes everywhere. 

**Argument 3**
I don't have categories and I'm doing fine.

**Counter**
Do you have more than 300 notes or so? You have categories. You just aren't calling them that. 
- Tags are a form of category, they are fluid. They don't scale well as your note collection grows though. [^2] 
- Starred notes are another form of mostly fluid structuring. 
- Do you have "daily notes" or timestamped notes? Certainly seems like a category to me; and a rigid one at that! [^3] 
If you only have notes that are directly linked to other notes—and nothing else—then you can truly say you have no categories. The price for no categorization is steep.

[^2]: But if you have Boolean searches to your notes, it *mostly* can mitigate the scaling problem—then you'd just have to remember the correct tags, which in practice isn't a certainty.
[^3]: Even though it's a more rigid category, I just can't give up on the multi-pronged power of the Temporal Context. Give up chronologically-date notes at your own discretion. Your future self may be disappointed.
