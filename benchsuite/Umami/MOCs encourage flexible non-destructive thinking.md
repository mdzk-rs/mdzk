# MOCs encourage flexible non-destructive thinking
MOCs allow for flexible idea rearrangement because you can map the same bits of information in completely different ways.

Take a second to unpack what's going on here. This highlights a profound but underappreciated aspect of MOCs. 

> MOCs allow for limitless interpretations. The only limit is your imagination.

Check out (3) extra MOCs below. They all use the exact same 19 concepts, but for different purposes. This type of awesome relational/positional thinking doesn't happen with a rigid table of contents. 

## Concepts by category
These are random categories that I chose because they make sense to me. Yours might be entirely different; and yet we both profit immensely from the exercise.

### For Strategy
- [[OODA Loop]]
- [[Levels of Magnification]]  
- [[Refraction Thinking]]

### For Improvement
- [[Reps]] 
- [[Flow]]
- [[Shadow Clone]]
- [[Forcing Function]] 

### Natural Selection
- [[Natural Selection]]
- [[Hormesis]]
- [[Antifragility]]
- [[Cause and Effect]]
- [[Lindy Effect]] 

### Finding Balance
- [[Ying and Yang]]
- [[Synthesis]]
- [[Seasons]]

### Dealing with Aggression
- [[No-Face]]
- [[The Id]]
- [[Aikido deflects and dissipates an attacker's energy]] 

### For Expanding Perspective
- [[Rubik's Cube]]
- [[Munger's Mental Models]]

## Concepts by A-Z sorting
A-Z manual lists are usually a waste of time because they will just become outdated. Just use #concept instead.
