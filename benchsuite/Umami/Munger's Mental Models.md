# Munger's Mental Models
## Short List of Munger's Models
* Math (Munger is particularly fond of the algebraic idea of inversion, that is, to solve a problem you address it backwards)
* Accounting (and its limits)
* Engineering (according to Munger, the ideas of redundancies and break-points are applicable outside of engineering and can be applied to business)
* Economics
* Probability
* Psychology (specifically the cognitive biases that cause us to make terrible decisions)
* Chemistry
* Evolutionary biology (can provide insights into economics)
* History
* Statistics
