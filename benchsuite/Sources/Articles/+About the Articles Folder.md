...okay a little more explanation. For millennia, humanity didn't have easy access to quality information. For ≈20 years, humanity has WAAYYY too much access to information. We've been trained over-collect this information. But we're finding out that strategy leads to under-thinking and overwhelm. (See: Anywhere I share opinions about this.)

There are healthier strategies to managing the NOISE out there. This is one tiny tactic amidst the broader strategy of better knowledge management.
